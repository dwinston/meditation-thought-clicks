meditation-thought-clicks
=========================

Track returns from thought during meditation

This app plots the durations between thinking-recoveries for each session. 
Marvel at your progress over time as you gradually increase your 
median in-session "clear head" duration.

This is a Meteor app, so install Meteor if you need to

    $ curl https://install.meteor.com | sh

and then, in the directory you've cloned into, simply run

    $ meteor
    
and check it out on http://localhost:3000
